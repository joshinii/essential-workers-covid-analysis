# Essential Workers Mental Health Analysis: April 2021 - August 2022

## Summary

This analysis examines mental health differences between essential workers with and without children
using data from April 2021 through August 2022 of the Household Pulse Survey (weeks 28-48).

### Key Findings

**Anxiety:**
- Essential workers with children had higher rates than those without children
- Average difference: +2.5 percentage points
- Statistical significance: SIGNIFICANT (p=0.000)
- Meaningful differences observed in 45% of weeks

**Worry:**
- Essential workers with children had higher rates than those without children
- Average difference: +2.7 percentage points
- Statistical significance: SIGNIFICANT (p=0.000)
- Meaningful differences observed in 70% of weeks

**Depression:**
- Essential workers with children had lower rates than those without children
- Average difference: -0.3 percentage points
- Statistical significance: not significant (p=0.448)
- Meaningful differences observed in 30% of weeks

## Methodology

### Data Source
- U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey, April 2021 - August 2022 (weeks 28-48)

### Essential Worker Classification
- **Weeks 28-33:** SETTING codes 1, 9, 11, 12, 15
- **Weeks 34-48:** SETTING codes 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 14, 15, 18

### Data Hygiene
- Excluded nonresponse codes (-99, -88)
- Excluded 'None of the above' responses
- Required valid survey weights

### Mental Health Measures
- Anxiety: 'Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge'
- Worry: 'Not being able to stop or control worrying'
- Depression: 'Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless'
- Scoring: >=3 on 4-point scale = positive screening

## Statistical Analysis

### Approach
- Survey-weighted prevalence rates calculated for each week
- Compared essential workers with vs. without children
- Used t-tests to assess overall significance

## Interpretation

### What the Results Mean

**Significant Differences Found:**
- Essential workers with children show consistently higher rates of anxiety/worry
- These differences appear to be genuine patterns, not random variation
- The 'double burden' of essential work + childcare may create additional stress

**Depression Shows Different Pattern:**
- No consistent difference in depression rates
- May indicate that childcare burden affects acute stress more than mood

### Statistical Significance Explained

- **p < 0.05**: Less than 5% chance differences are due to random variation
- **Percentage points**: Direct difference in rates (e.g., 25% vs 23% = 2 percentage points)
- **Meaningful difference**: We considered >=2 percentage points as practically important

### Limitations

- Cross-sectional design (snapshot at each time point)
- Self-reported mental health symptoms
- Essential worker definition changed between periods
- Cannot establish causation, only association

## Conclusion

This analysis provides evidence that essential workers with child caregiving responsibilities
may experience elevated stress-related symptoms compared to those without children.
The findings suggest a 'double burden' effect that persists across multiple weeks
of observation during the pandemic period.
